/* Question : Consider a bishop, a knight and a rook on an n Ã— m chessboard. They are said to form a triangle if each piece attacks exactly one other piece and is attacked by exactly one piece. 
                Calculate the number of ways to choose positions of the pieces to form a triangle.

                Note that the bishop attacks pieces sharing the common diagonal with it; the rook attacks in horizontal and vertical directions; and, finally, the knight 
                attacks squares which are two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally away from its position. */
