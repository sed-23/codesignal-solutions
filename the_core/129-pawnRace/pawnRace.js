/* Question : Pawn race is a game for two people, played on an ordinary 8 Ã— 8 chessboard. The first player has a white pawn, the second one - a black pawn. 
                Initially the pawns are placed somewhere on the board so that the 1st and the 8th rows are not occupied. Players take turns to make a move. */
